% Scientific Reports Template 
% Version 1 

% The template includes 8 subfiles:
% 1. Title / authors / affiliations
% 2. Abstract
% 3. Introduction
% 4. Materials and Methods
% 5. Results
% 6. Discussion
% 7. References
% 8. Addendum
% 9. Figures / Tables ?

% This file puts everything in order. This way, we wont end up having a huge (messy) file with over 1000 lines. It will be easier to work on each section separately, make changes where needed etc..

% All the figures and tables are in the figures folder, and the suppl material are in the suppl folder. 

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% PREAMBLE STARTS HERE:

% I will be using the "wlscirep" package. This package comes with 2 files: {wlscirep, naturemag.bst}. These two files should be placed in the same directory as all the other files of the article.


% Import packages
\documentclass[fleqn,10pt]{wlscirep}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}

% it is suggested that the "subfiles" package is defined as last in the preamble.. no idea why!
\usepackage{subfiles}

% add the abstract. In the wlscirep package, the abstract goes in the preamble and not in the main document. 
\input{abstract}
